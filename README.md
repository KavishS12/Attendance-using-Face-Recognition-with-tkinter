<h1>Attendance Managment Sustem using Face Recogniton</h1>

This project aims to develop an Attendance Management System using Face Recognition technology integrated with a SQL database. The system automates the process of marking attendance in educational institutions, eliminating the need for manual recording and providing real-time updates. It utilizes Python libraries such as OpenCV and face_recognition for facial recognition, Tkinter for the user interface, and SQL for database management.

This version is an enhanced iteration of the attendance system project previously developed.You can check it out [here](https://github.com/KavishS12/Attendance-using-Face-Recognition).<br>
The previous version used streamlit as the ui while this one uses tkinter,which provided a faster respose time on average.<br>In additon, this project expands the usage of SQL as the database ,helping capture attendance for different subjects,recording it for the date required and also provides an in-dept analysis of student attendance record,their attendance percentage for a particular subject,etc.
